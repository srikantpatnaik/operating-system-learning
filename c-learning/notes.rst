Notes
=====

#. Pointers are special variables used to store address of another variable
#. Pointers can be used to alter multiple variables through function
#. Addresss operator(&), Dereferencing operator(*) are prefix unary operators
#. Ampersand(&) front of variable will get its address
#. Asterisk(*) front of a pointer get the value at the memory address pointed to
#. Conversion specifier for pointers is %p
#. On a running program, variable declaration occured, program makes a request 
   for some memory, the OS assigns 
#. Pointers allow functions to alter variables outside of their own scope
#. Passing a pointer to a function one can allow function to read/write to the 
   data stored in that variable
#. Changing the address value manually in a pointer would lead to segmentation
   fault, as it would tries to access segment of memory which it doesn't has permission
#. Structured data types: arrays and structs
#. Struct is a variable too
#. Default variables in C fall in auto storage class, means they get created and freed
   automatically (destroyed when out of the scope, to free memory)
#.
